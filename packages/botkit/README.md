# @xmtp/botkit

Minimal viable package for creating bots.

## CLI Quickstart

For a streamlined setup process, you can use the `create-xmtp-bot` CLI tool, which simplifies the creation and configuration of new XMTP bots.

```bash
npx create-xmtp-bot@latest bot-name
```

Please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/xmtp/botkit/tree/main/create-xmtp-bot).

## Overview

Here's a basic example of the code with a bot that responds with a gm:

```tsx
import { run, HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/botkit";

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, senderAddress } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.reply(`gm`);
});
```
